# Resonite Events Frontend

This project uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/).

Currently just a frontend mockup made with [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/) for Resonite Events, using the API form [resonite-communities](https://resonite-communities.com/).

## Developing

After installed dependencies with `bun i`, start a development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

## Building

There is a Dockerfile and compose in teh works

But for now, to build a production version of this project locally, run:

```bash
bun run build
```

You can preview the production build with `bun preview`.
